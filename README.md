# Playbooks Repository

This is LogicVein's public repository for company and community contributed Playbooks for use in our Net LineDancer and ThirdEye Suite products. The repository is organized by Vendor and Operating System.

> [!TIP]
> If you have a Playbook that you would like to contribute, export the JSON file from the product and submit it here as a *Pull request*. A team member will review it, provide possible feedback, and merge it if it passes quality and correctness checks.
